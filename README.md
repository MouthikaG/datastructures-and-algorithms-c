# Data Structures and Algorithms in C

This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
programs implemented using the C programming language.

Each program focuses on a specific DSA concept and is written in a clear,
menu-driven or modular style wherever applicable. The goal of this repository
is to strengthen fundamental understanding through hands-on practice.

## 📌 Contents
This repository includes C programs related to:

- Arrays and array-based operations  
- Searching algorithms (linear search, binary search)  
- Sorting algorithms (bubble sort, heap sort, comparisons)  
- Stack implementations (array and linked list)  
- Queue implementations (array, circular queue, deque)  
- Linked lists (singly and doubly linked lists)  
- Trees (binary tree traversals, BST operations, AVL tree)  
- Graph algorithms (BFS and DFS traversals)  
- Recursion-based problems (Tower of Hanoi, GCD, Josephus problem)  
- Expression evaluation (infix, postfix, arithmetic expressions)  
- Matrix operations and polynomial operations  

Each program is stored as an individual `.c` file and named descriptively
for easy identification and navigation.

## ⚙️ How to Run
You can compile and run any program using a C compiler.

Example:
gcc filename.c -o output
./output


(Programs were written and tested using **Dev-C++**, which internally uses
a GCC-based compiler.)

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository documents my learning journey in Data Structures and Algorithms
using C. It focuses on:

- Understanding core DSA concepts  
- Improving logical thinking and problem-solving skills  
- Writing clean and readable C code  
- Building a strong foundation for advanced topics  

## 🔄 Future Updates
- More DSA programs may be added  
- Programs may be grouped into folders by topic  
- Code optimizations and improvements may be made
